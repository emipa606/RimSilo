  <NoOneInSquadConfirm>This operation will take away the last colonist in this map!
Your animals won't be fed, buildings on the map won't be maintained, prisoners  will escape or starve to death if there are no colonists in a map.

Meanwhile, no one is able to operate the terminal, so you'll not be able to access your services in this map until the return of a colonist.

Are you sure to take away the last colonist?</NoOneInSquadConfirm>
