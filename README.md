# PS

PS. **[u]Select a colonist and right-click the ATM Terminal, then select "RimSilo™ Professional Storing Service" in the float menu to access the UI.[/u]**
PS2. If you get stuck while solving a payment, try to stop your mouse over icons or titles - A tooltip will emerge and lead the way.
PS3. Almost all the operations in this mod need at least one [u]active orbital trade beacon[/u], just like what you should do when trading with a tradership in the vanilla game.
PS4. (That was a joke in RuntimeGC)
PS5. If you have any questions, [u]check Info button ("i" icons) on the UI, or look up in the "FAQs" from the "Misc..."[/u]. It's not a bad idea that you check help contents before spending money, right?
PS6. The coremod of RimBank Series (aka this mod) and all sub mods must have the same MinorVersion number. Well if you cannot figure out what I'm talking about, just ignore it, a built-in ModChecker will take charge of it.
PS7. Post any errors or bugs on my forum thread or Steam workshop page.Your effort contributes to a better mod.Thanks!
